Please cite the paper.

1. Please download the hazy images and their corresponding ground truth images and put them in the "Hazy images" and "Ground Truth images" folder, respectively. The images can be downloaded from the links below:

RESIDE dataset - https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-standard
NYUDepthV2 dataset - https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html
HazeRD dataset - https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/hazerd-outdoor-scene-dataset-and-benchmark-single-image-dehazing
O-Haze dataset - https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire18/o-haze/

2. Run the file - 'demo_test.m' file in MATLAB to dehaze an image.

3. To generate synthetic transmission maps, run 'synthetic_transmission'.m' file in MATLAB.

4. To recover the haze-free images from synthetic transmission maps, run 'sample_recovery.m' file in MATLAB.
